This recipe shows how to split modules and lazy load them into your page using Webpack (v4) and React Router (v4).

- See `optimization.splitChunks` in `webpack.config.js` for a basic webpack config for code splitting.
- See `App.jsx` and `asyncRouterComponent` for lazy loading in React Router.

You can test this recipe in your browser by installing node packages and running `npm start`.
